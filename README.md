# Phishpic

Press the button to take a picture and instantly upload it to [Phishcave.com](http://phishcave.com).
I wrote this app to minimize the number of steps needed to share pictures with my chat buddies.

We have a bot set up in our IRC channel that shares anything uploaded by me (using Google+ login) so if I'm out on the town with someone and see something funny I can snap a pic and share with the guys without wasting time flipping through a bunch of menus and prompts, or having to paste the url manually when I get back home.
